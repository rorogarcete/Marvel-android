This application is in Kotlin and consumes Marvel Api to retrieve a list of Characters.
The architecture used is MVVM (Model View ViewModel) with a combination of recent Android Architecture Components released By Google.

## Libraries Used

* [Architecture](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/arch/) - A collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and maintainable apps. Start with classes for managing your UI component lifecycle and handling data persistence.
  * [DataBinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/) - - Declaratively bind observable data to UI elements.
  * [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) - Build data objects that notify views when the underlying database changes.
  * [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room) - Access your app's SQLite database with in-app objects and compile-time checks.
  * [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - - Store UI-related data that isn't destroyed on app rotations. Easily schedule asynchronous tasks for optimal execution.
